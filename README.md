## About

This project demonstrates professional React development with a focus on maintainability, testability, and architectural excellence:

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 15+** leveraging React Server Components and Client Components
- **React Hook Form** for robust form validation and state management
- **Framer Motion** for smooth, performant animations
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** with automatic class sorting via Biome
- **Biome** for lightning-fast linting and formatting

### Architecture & Practices

- **Clean Architecture** for clear separation of concerns and maintainability
- **SOLID Principles** applied throughout the codebase
- **Design Patterns** for scalable and reusable solutions
- **Comprehensive Testing** strategy covering unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Git workflow** with VCS integration for team collaboration

The codebase enforces strict code quality standards with 80-character line width, consistent 2-space indentation, and comprehensive linting rules optimized for React and Next.js development.
